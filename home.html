                                    I haven't blogged in a couple of weeks but I've been really busy. My younger brother is having his first child any day now so that's pretty exciting. I need to submit my website project for class as well as complete the Javascript course on Codecademy. It's gonna be a another busy week but atleast I won't have to work this upcoming Monday.

                                    Back to back great nights! Work was aight, but the highlight of the night was again trivia. Today was a special trivia night because The Pump was throwing a Quentin Tarantino themed costume party! To correspond with the costume party, trivia was also Tarantino based. Last week to prep for the this night, each member chose a Tarantino movie to study and I chose True Romance since I've never seen it. It was a great film where the two lovers get married and runaway together when they come into possession of $500,000 worth of coke. The Sicillian mob hunts them to recover their goods and a lot of violence ensues. Anyways back to trivia. We came somewhat prepared and each member dressed up as a Tarantino movie character. I didn't really put much effort into finding a character and costume so I chose Jules Winnfield from Pulp Fiction and I dressed as closely as I could to his character at the end of the film where he's at a resturaunt and two people try to rob the joint. We were solid in every round of trivia and had a sizeable lead all the way to the finish. We ended up winning trivia by 40 pts and cemented ourselves as the team to beat THe Pump.

                                    'Twas a great night! Today marks the third time i've seen Hannibal Buress perform standup and he brought the funny as always. My girlfiend and I attended the late show and it was a blast (even though we didn't get to sit right next to each other). Some of my favorite bits included Hannibal's arrest experience which was caught on an officer body cam and it was gold. Hannibal proceeded to speak to the camera as if he was on YouTube. There was another hilarious bit where he described his interaction with an Uber driver in I believe Nashville. The driver said he didn't have an aux cable so Hannibal couldn't play his own music. The driver continued to tell of his encounter with a rider who played this "Kanye West" song that included some very explicit racial slurs as the melody. The driver thought it was OK to repeat the lyrics and the ride became extremely awkward.

                                    Today, was an alright day. Work was fine, but the exciting part of the day was trivia at The Pump Bar. It rained almost all day so there wasn't a huge turnout for trivia tonight which means my trivia team could slay. Turns out, we did slay. We only missed two or three questions heading into the final round. After turning in the final question, we were almost positive we won the night since we were ahead by 14 pts over the second place team. Unfortunately we lost on a technicality and didn't place at all. It was a bummer for a second but since we're regulars, the trivia DJ bought us a round of drinks.
